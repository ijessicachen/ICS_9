  Assignment: Unit 5 Lesson 1
    6: Create a graphics program that will draw balloons using loops. 
    Balloons of a few different sizes should be created. A string suspended
    from the balloon may be included. Bonus marks for having the balloons 
    filled not with a fill command but with stroke.

  MY NOTES AND PLAN:
    Okay so I think it'd be cool to make this an animation
    I could make the ballons points but I feel if I make them ellipses there 
    will be more freedom
    Lines would just be straight and I could modify their length. If they 
    were wavy that'd just be too complicated for me.
